# Probability-of-Detection

In this repository I tried to calculate the probabilities of detection of the received signal versus several values of SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) for each detection method : Matched_Filter , Cross_Correlation , Energy_Detection and Goertzel_Algorithm over MATLAB. So, enough intro !! we have a lot of to do, thus lets dig in.
